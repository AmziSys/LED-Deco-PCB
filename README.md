# LED-Deco-PCB
---------------------------- LED-Deco-PCB -----------------------------

* Intro:
  
  The idea is to design a simple decoration circuit that automatically turns the lights on an off, and it can be used in special events or parties (Astable Multivibrator - Flip Flop)

* Design:

  - LEDs: Red, Green and Orange
  - Transistors
  - Resistors
  - Capacitors
  - Battery (CR-2354/HFN)

* The board was designed using Kicad 8, and simulated on Proteus
